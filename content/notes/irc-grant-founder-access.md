description: "Grant 'super user' access for a IRC channel."

"Founder access" is basically a super user for the channel. Only they can give ops to other users. At least on Freenode, this is limited to some small number of people. I believe 5 or 6 is the max for number of founders a channel can have.

This is an example of what needed to be done when Sylvan granted me founder access to #ponylang:

`/msg chanserv flags #ponylang seantallen +F`
