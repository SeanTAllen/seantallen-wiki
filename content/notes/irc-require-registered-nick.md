The Internet is a spammy place and IRC channel often become spammy. Bots arrive and start spamming the channel. When this happens, set the channel to require a registered nick to join and usually, things will get better. 

To do this for a channel called `#ponylang` you would do:

`/mode #ponylang +r`

Note, as with any channel mode change, you most have ops for the channel in question.
